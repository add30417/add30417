- 👋 Hi, I’m @add30417
- 👀 I’m interested in the field of IoT.
- ⚙️ I’m developed and setup many small private IoT project's at parent's and my home. Some (arduino) projects running since 2011 without interruption or hardware changes. During corona lockdown, I improved and enhanced my projects. In this time, almost all small projects could connected to a bigger solution, the central component is a clock which shows (secretly) the status.
- 📝 I'm using different programming languages. For the latest projects, I'm using python, js, bash, mariadb, php ... . In the past, during my professional software engineer career, I used various of language and products: C, C++, C#, Java, ASP, AJAX, AS400, MySQL, Oracle, VBS, PHP... 
- 🧱 I'm using especially ESP32/ES8266 from Olimex in the latest projects. But open to try new hardware, the latest new discovery is M5Stack.
- 🧰 I'm using Apple hardware for the development activies.
- Projects:
  - Mailbox notifier
  - Outdoor keypad
  - Smart watch
  - Smart alarm clock
  - Smart home (e.g. https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pytradfri)
  - Photovoltaic system status panel
  - Smartmeter network interface with power relay function
  - Outdoor temperatur sensor network interface
  - Weather station network interface
  - LEGO Powered Up Train network interface and automation control (https://github.com/nathankellenicki/node-poweredup)
  - Connect the heater with my smarthome (https://github.com/schmiegelt/Py-Weishaupt-WCM-COM)
