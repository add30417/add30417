- 👋 Hi, I’m @add30417
- 👀 I’m interested in the field of IoT.
- ⚙️ I’m developed and setup many small private IoT project's at parent's and my home. Some (arduino) projects running since 2011 without interruption or hardware changes. During corona lockdown, I improved and enhanced my projects. In this time, almost all small projects could connected to a bigger solution, the central component is a clock which shows (secretly) the status.
- 📝 I'm using different programming languages. For the latest projects, I'm using python, js, bash, mariadb, php ... . In the past, during my professional software engineer career, I used various of language and products: C, C++, C#, Java, ASP, AJAX, AS400, MySQL, Oracle, VBS, PHP... 
- 🧱 I'm using especially ESP32/ES8266 from Olimex in the latest projects. But open to try new hardware, the latest new discover is M5Stack.
- 🧰 I'm using Apple hardware for the development activies.
- Projects:
  -- Mailbox notifier
  -- Outdoor keypad
  -- Smart watch
  -- Smart alarm clock
  -- Photovoltaic system status panel
